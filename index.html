The hen does not completely change into a rooster, however. This transition is limited to making the bird phenotypically male, meaning that although the hen will develop physical characteristics that will make her look male, she will remain genetically female.
One method that does work on some breeds is wing sexing. Wing sexing can only be done within the first 48 hours of when the chick hatches. Hens' wing feathers are two different lengths while roosters' are the same length. So in the photos above, the chick on the left is a female, while the chick on the right is a male.
Take a sharp knife, grab his head, stretch him out, and slice the neck right through the spine just under the bill. Do it quick in one fast, deliberate motion. He'll be dead before you check to see if you got any blood on you. He'll flop and bleed out in just a couple minutes.
